**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

**Start the built-in web server**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but the built-in web server works
great:

```
php bin/console server:run
```

Now check out the site at `http://localhost:8000`
